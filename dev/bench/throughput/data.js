          "message": "bench: client load-sweep (client latency vs throughput) + Pages charts (#315)\n\n* docs: link the JMH benchmark trends (GitHub Pages) from the README\n\nAdd a Benchmarks badge + section pointing to the GitHub Pages trend chart\npublished by the Wave 2 benchmark radar:\nhttps://falkordb.github.io/JFalkorDB/dev/bench/\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* docs: clarify benchmarks run on PRs targeting master (CodeRabbit)\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* bench: measure client latency (total − server) across a load sweep + curve\n\nReplace the single-op JMH benchmark with a client load-sweep harness that\nisolates client-side cost — total round-trip minus the server's reported\ninternal execution time (QUERY_INTERNAL_EXECUTION_TIME) — across concurrency\nlevels {1,2,4,8,16,32,64}. A single command is mostly server time, so only a\nload sweep reveals connection/thread-management effects (pool contention today;\nnon-blocking / Project-Loom variants later). Per level it reports client latency\np50/p95/p99 and throughput.\n\nRadar: two github-action-benchmark suites — client latency (smaller-is-better)\nand throughput (bigger-is-better) — plus a published latency-vs-throughput\nsaturation curve (Chart.js) and a landing page on GitHub Pages (master only).\nInformational, SHA-pinned. `just bench` runs the sweep; `just bench-one \"1,8,64\"`\nruns specific levels. Drops the JMH deps; the module stays standalone/non-deployable.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* ci(bench): skip-fetch-gh-pages on the second radar step to avoid the double-fetch\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* bench: harden the load harness (locale, validation, start-gate, failures) + tests\n\nAddress AI review on the new load benchmark:\n- Serialize JSON with Locale.ROOT so non-EN locales can't emit comma decimals\n  (invalid JSON for github-action-benchmark / the Pages chart).\n- Validate inputs: bench.loads (positive ints, non-empty), bench.measureMs (>0),\n  bench.warmupMs (>=0) — no more NaN throughput / meaningless zero metrics.\n- Release all workers from a start gate and start timing only once every worker\n  is ready, so high-concurrency phases don't ramp up gradually and bias\n  throughput and the saturation curve.\n- Propagate worker exceptions (fail the run instead of publishing partial/zero\n  metrics on a silent worker failure).\n- Use a unique per-run graph name (bench.graph overridable) so pointing at an\n  external server can't delete a pre-existing graph.\n- Add SRI + crossorigin to the Chart.js CDN <script> in curve.html.\n- Add LoadBenchmarkTest: percentile math, parseLoads validation, locale-safe JSON.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* bench: fail fast when the server execution time can't be parsed (Copilot)\n\nserverNanos previously returned 0 on any missing/unparseable value, which would\nsilently turn client latency back into full round-trip latency and publish\nmisleading metrics if the server ever changed the QUERY_INTERNAL_EXECUTION_TIME\nformat. Throw a descriptive IllegalStateException instead — it propagates via the\nworker failure path, so the run fails loudly rather than reporting wrong numbers.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* test(bench): unit-test parseServerNanos for valid + all bad-input cases\n\nExtract server-time parsing into parseServerNanos(String) and cover it:\n- valid: \"0.5 milliseconds\", \"2 milliseconds\", \"0.25\" (no unit), surrounding\n  whitespace, and a realistic \"0.229334 milliseconds\";\n- fail-fast (IllegalStateException) for null, \"\", whitespace-only, a unit-only\n  string, non-numeric tokens, malformed numbers (\"1.2.3\"), and \"0x10\".\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* bench: use a constant parameterized point-lookup in the hot loop (Copilot)\n\nConcatenating the random id into the Cypher text on every iteration built a\ndistinct query per sample, adding Java-side string work and forcing the server\nto re-parse/re-plan each query. That parse/plan cost isn't in\nQUERY_INTERNAL_EXECUTION_TIME, so it inflated the reported client latency.\n\nUse a constant query text (\"MATCH (n:N {id: $id}) RETURN n.id\") with a reusable\nparams map so the server reuses its cached plan and the timed sample no longer\npays for per-iteration string building.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* perf(bench): parse server time without a per-sample regex (CodeRabbit)\n\nparseServerNanos ran split(\"\\\\s+\") on every measured sample; the multi-char\nregex bypasses String.split's fast-path and recompiles a Pattern each call,\nadding GC/CPU noise to the load generator's hot loop (and it trimmed twice).\n\nExtract the leading numeric token with a manual whitespace scan instead: trims\nonce, allocates at most one substring, and keeps the any-whitespace separator\nbehavior so every existing parseServerNanos test still passes.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* fix(bench): stop container on driver-init failure; validate server time unit (Copilot)\n\nTwo Copilot findings on the load harness:\n\n- If FalkorDB.driver(host, port) threw, the just-started Testcontainers\n  container was never stopped (creation sat outside the try/finally), leaking a\n  running container. Move driver creation inside the try and null-guard cleanup\n  so container.stop() always runs.\n\n- parseServerNanos always treated the numeric token as milliseconds without\n  checking the unit, so a server unit change (seconds/microseconds) would\n  silently miscompute client latency. Validate the suffix is empty or a\n  millisecond spelling (ms/millisecond/milliseconds) and fail fast otherwise.\n  Added tests for accepted spellings and rejected units.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* docs(bench): correct the LOOKUP_QUERY comment about client string building (Copilot)\n\nThe comment claimed each sample 'doesn't pay for Cypher string building', but\nGraph.query(String, Map) -> Utils.prepareQuery still builds a 'CYPHER id=<v>\n<body>' string every call. Reword to reflect reality: the win is a constant\nquery *body* so the server reuses its cached plan (vs re-parsing/re-planning a\ndistinct query per iteration); the client-side param serialization is legitimate\ncost the benchmark is meant to measure.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* ci(bench): drop contents:write on PR benchmark runs (least privilege) (Copilot)\n\nThe single benchmark job granted contents:write to every run, including\npull_request runs that execute untrusted PR code via 'just bench' (the PR's own\nJustfile) — a privilege-escalation risk for same-repo PR branches. Since GitHub\nActions doesn't allow expressions in 'permissions', split by event:\n\n- benchmark-pr (pull_request): contents:read + pull-requests:write — only\n  compares against the master baseline and comments regressions; never pushes.\n- benchmark-master (push): contents:write — stores the baseline/trend and\n  publishes the curve to gh-pages.\n\nBoth run the same 'just bench' recipe; behavior per event is unchanged.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* fix(bench): reject non-finite/negative server times in parseServerNanos (Copilot)\n\nDouble.parseDouble accepts NaN/Infinity/negative tokens, and casting them to\nnanoseconds yields 0 or garbage — silently corrupting the client-latency metric\n(server=0 collapses it back to full round-trip; huge/negative values distort it).\nValidate the parsed value is finite and non-negative and fail fast otherwise.\nAdded tests covering NaN, Infinity, -Infinity, negative, and overflow (1e999)\ntokens with and without a unit suffix.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* docs(bench): drop stale JMH references from Justfile + benchmarks POM (Copilot)\n\nThis PR replaced the JMH benchmark with the client load-sweep harness, but the\n'just bench' section header/comment and the benchmarks POM header still called it\na 'JMH benchmark harness' and referenced JMH deps. Reword both to describe the\nload-sweep harness and the latency/throughput/curve JSON it emits, so module docs\nmatch reality.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n* perf(bench): avoid per-iteration Integer autoboxing; guard sample-count overflow (Copilot)\n\n- The measured loop autoboxed a fresh Integer per iteration for the id param;\n  that allocation/GC isn't client-library cost and adds noise at high throughput.\n  Pre-box the ids once (IDS) and index into them so no boxing happens per sample.\n\n- summarize accumulated the total sample count in an int used for array sizing;\n  a long measureMs / high throughput could overflow it into a negative array size\n  and wrong throughput. Accumulate in a long and fail fast if it exceeds what a\n  single Java array can hold.\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>",
